# Starting points for Computer Vision Modeling

## Objective

The *"computer-vision-baselines"* repository contains a set of **baseline notebooks** for computer vision modeling tasks such as **classification**, **object detection**, and **semantic segmentation**.   

These notebooks serve as **a starting point for your computer vision projects** and can help you get up and running quickly. Whether you're a seasoned computer vision expert or just getting started, I hope you find these notebooks helpful. 

- **Image Classification** ([**GitHub**](1_Classification_PyTorch_EfficientNetV2.ipynb) / [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/shnakazawa/image-classification-with-pytorch-and-efficientnet) / [**Japanese article**](https://zenn.dev/aidemy/articles/f851fb091dbb23))
- **Object Detection** ([**GitHub**](2_Object_Detection_PyTorch_DETR.ipynb) / [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/shnakazawa/object-detection-with-pytorch-and-detr) / [**Japanese article**](https://zenn.dev/aidemy/articles/30f10cf2c48e6a)) 
- **Semantic Segmentation** ([**GitHub**](3_Semantic_Sgmentation_PyTorch_U-Net.ipynb) / [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shnakazawa/semantic-segmentation-with-pytorch-and-u-net) / [**Japanese article**](https://zenn.dev/aidemy/articles/a43ebe82dfbb8b)) 

Please feel free to contribute to the repository by submitting your own notebooks or suggesting improvements to the existing ones. Thank you for visiting!

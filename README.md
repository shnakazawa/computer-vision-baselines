# Starting points for Computer Vision Modeling

## Objective

The "computer-vision-baselines" repository contains a set of **baseline notebooks** for computer vision modeling tasks such as **classification**, **object detection**, and **semantic segmentation**.   

These notebooks serve as **a starting point for your computer vision projects** and can help you get up and running quickly. Whether you're a seasoned computer vision expert or just getting started, we hope you find these notebooks helpful. 

You can directly run them on Kaggle. The links are: 
- [**Image Classification**](1_Classification_PyTorch_EfficientNetV2.ipynb)
- [**Object Detection**](2_Object_Detection_PyTorch_DETR.ipynb)
- Semantic Segmentation (TBA)

Please feel free to contribute to the repository by submitting your own notebooks or suggesting improvements to the existing ones. Thank you for visiting!
